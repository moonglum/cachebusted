# Contributing

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

We welcome any kind of contribution: Documentation, code, issues, discussions, critique, speaking about it...

We are using [editorconfig](http://EditorConfig.org). Please install the according plugin in your editor before making code contributions. The code is written in [standard style](http://standardjs.com).

All features need to be tested with [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape). You can run them with `npm test`. They will also be automatically run before committing.

Our merge strategy is [Rebasing & Merging](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits).
